This notebook contains scripts that were essential to my work as a neuroscience researcher at the National Institutes of Health. Using Python, Excel, and R, I was able to:
1) analyze fMRI timing across all subjects
2) create summary files of participants' scores on behavioral tasks
3) Run correlations between datapoints to reveal hidden connections within the dataset
